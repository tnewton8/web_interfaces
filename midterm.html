<h1>Tasha Newton's Midterm</h1>
    <p> I took this class, because it seemed the only one that looked intresting in my minor. I hope that if my major doesn't work I could use my minor. It looked intresting and I'm on online a lot. I could use this to build websites. In the end I also need the credits to graduate later.</p>

    <!--I used Itunes since most people I now get their "legal" music from them since we rather not pay $15 for an entire ablum when we only wonted one song.-->
