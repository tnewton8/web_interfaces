       <p style="text-indent: 5em;">This site is focused on art that isn’t really seen or recognized as art. I (Tasha N.) have collected graffiti from bathrooms and pictures of posters that are seen all over Auraria campus in Denver, Colorado. I think these things are art forms that are ignored. I believe that anything that has been done by a person should be considered art. It isn’t going to be everything people expect to be considered art. Everyone has their own taste, and if it insults them, then shrug it off. Observe these works and give input in a forgotten or illegal (graffiti) art that is scattered throughout Auraria.</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 5em;">The Experiment Graffiti page was an experiment on Auraria campus.  I put black papers, with the request not to throw them away until I could collect them in English and Spanish. February 4th I put blank paper in West Classroom bathrooms, the first floor and the second floor. I went into the Art building and put blank paper in a stall in the first and second floor bathrooms. Next I went into central restrooms and put papers in all three levels. Sadly, this experiment was only done in the women’s restrooms. I collected the blanks for the first two weeks (2/4-2/11/14) and saw people where confused on what to do on them. For one week (2/18 & 2/20/2014) I added that they should draw and write on the papers. I was getting a lot more graffiti, once given permission. Then to avoid losing more papers I added then a date (2/25 & 2/27/14). Sadly this didn't stop the staff from throwing the sheets away, they were only doing their job. I even moved the experiment into Tivoli. For doing this experiment for a month, I have come to the conclusion that people are artistic and little weird in the most odd of places. People did more art when they were given permission to do so, eliminating the fear of getting in trouble for drawing on the project. I hope to get back onto this project to continue to observe bathroom graffiti.  </p>
